- Sequence vs series?
a sequence is a function from N -> R
a series is sum of a sequence. 

if sequence of partial sums converges, the series converges

## Convergence

- a series converges if it has a unique limit point. 
- If a series 's' converges to certain 'l',
$$|s_n - l| < \epsilon \space \forall \space n  $$
- If a series 's' converges to certain 'l', if to every $\epsilon$ there exist a real number $m(\epsilon)$ such that
$$|s_n - l| < \epsilon \space \forall \space n < m $$
