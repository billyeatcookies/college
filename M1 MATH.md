- Sequence vs series?
a sequence is a function from N -> R
a series is sum of a sequence. 

if sequence of partial sums converges, the series converges

## Convergence

- a series converges if it has a unique limit point. 
- If a series 's' converges to certain 'l',
$$|s_n - l| < \epsilon \space \forall \space n  $$
- If a series 's' converges to certain 'l', if to every $\epsilon$ there exist a real number $m(\epsilon)$ such that
$$|s_n - l| < \epsilon \space \forall \space n < m $$

The sequence $a_n$ converges to the number L if for every positive number P there corresponds an integer N such that for all n,
$$ n > N => |a_n - L | < \epsilon$$
if no such L exist, it diverges.

The sequence {$na_n$} diverges to infinity if for every number M there is an integer N such that for all n larger than N, $a_n > M$. If this condition holds we write

$$ \lim_{n->\infty} a_n = b$$
