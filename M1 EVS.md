- Definition of environment?
environment is a type of system which consist of biotic and abiotic components which are interdependent for their survival.

- Definition environmental science?
the study of environment with the living organisms and how they interact with the environment. 

- Components of environment?
lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere corresponding to rocks, water, air and life respectively.

- what's ecology?
Ecology isÂ the study of living organisms and how they interact among themselves and also with the surrounding physical environment.

- types of ecology?
molecular, organisms, communities, population and ecosystem.

- autoecology vs syncology?
autoecology is study of individual organisms. syncology is the study of whole organism communities or a group of organisms.

- definition of ecosystem?
functional unit of nature which contains the biotic community and abiotic environment.

- types of ecosystem?
terrestrial and aquatic. **terrestrial** are land based ecosystems that include forest, grassland, tundra, desert.
**aquatic are water body based** that include freshwater and marine.

- structure of ecosystem?

abiotic and biotic components. 

#### abiotic
non living things

climate factor -> factors that affect climate.  temperature, humidity, wind, rain 
edapic factor -> soil properties such as pH, minerals, tropography

#### biotic
biotic include producers, consumers, decomposers

- what are producers?
all **autotrophs** such as plants. they produce food by photosynthesis. 

- discuss types of consumer types?
**heterotrophs** that feed on other organisms

**primary** -> herbivorous, organisms which consumes the producers (eg. goat, cow, rabbit)
**secondary** -> animals which feed on the primary consumers (eg. cat, fox)
**tertiary** -> large carnivorous which feed on tertiary (eg. snake)
**quaternary** -> prey on tertiary, they have no predators

- what are decomposers?
**saprophytes** such as fungi and bacteria. thrive on dead and decaying organic matter. 

- service of ecosystem?
regulates the essential ecological processes, supports life systems. 
cycling nutrients bw biotic and abiotic.
maintains balance among various trophic levels.
cycles minerals through biosphere.
abiotic components help in synthesis of organic components that involve exchange of energy.

- functional units/components of ecosystem?
**productivity** -> refers to rate of biomass production
**energy flow** -> the sequential process thru which energy flows from one trophic level to another. energy captures from sun flows from producers to consumer and then to decomposers and finally back to environment.
**decomposition** -> process of breakdown of dead organic material. top-soil is the major site for decomposition.
**nutrient cycling** -> nutrients are consumed and recycled back in various forms for the utilization by various organisms. 

- what is bio-geo chemical cycle?
the ways in which a nutrient or element moves bw various geological components that are biotic and abiotic, across the biosphere. 
this include cycles of nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, phosphorous and sulpher.

- Difference bw exchange pool and reservoir pool
**Reservoir pool** include large abiotic factors such as the atmosphere, oceans etc. They are the primary source of the element or the nutrient storehouse. less active and exchange of element is very slow. Elements are retained for longer periods of time.
**Exchange pool** include the biotic factors such as plants and animals. It is characterized by rapid exchange of elements. It holds element for short periods of time. 

- what is nitrification?
microbial process by which reduced nitrogen components get sequentially oxidized to nitate and nitrite.

- what is denitrification?
microbial process that converts nitrate to nitrogen gas, removing bio available nitrogen and returning it to the atmosphere.

- aerobic vs anaerobic?
aerobic is characterized by presence of free oxygen O2.
