## Anti aromatic
4. 4n pi e- (multiples of 4)

> [!Note] 
> If the number of pi electrons is >= 8, then the anti aromatically identified compound will be non-aromatic due to stability of non aromatic is more than anti aromatic.

## Geometrical Isomers

### Trans isomer
- Melting point high
- Rest of properties low
- no cyclic compound formation
