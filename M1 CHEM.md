## Aromaticity
1. Cyclic
2. Planar
3. Conjugated (pi, sig, pi, sig +, pi, sig LP)
4. (4n + 2) pi e- **2, 6, 10, 14, ...**

## Anti aromatic
4. 4n pi e- (multiples of 4)

> [!Note] 
> If the number of pi electrons is >= 8, then the anti aromatically identified compound will be non-aromatic due to stability of non aromatic is more than anti aromatic.

## Geometrical Isomers

### Trans isomer
- Melting point high
- Rest of properties low
- no cyclic compound formation

## Optical Isomers

- what are optical isomers?
They can rotate plan-polarized light. two types - D and L (left)
if contains chiral carbon -> optically active

- what is a racemic mixture?
mixture of both L and D forms 
- what is a resolution mixture?
separation of L and D forms
- what is walden conversion?
L form -> D form or vice versa.

- what is fischer projection?

- what are E and Z isomers?

Z will have high priority substituents on same side of double bond
E will have them on opposite sides of double bond
