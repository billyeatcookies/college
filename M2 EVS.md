- what is pollution?
things (that cause discomfort, harm to physical systems, living organisms) -> environment
- pollutants - form
**primary**: released directly from source to atmosphere (SO2, N-oxides, CO)
**secondary**: not emitted directly to atmosphere, but by chemical reactions involving primary.

- pollutants - ecosystem POV
**biodegradable**: decomposes gradually in nature (domestic sewage, vegetables)
**slowly degradable**: cannot decompose in natural way (plastics, DDT)
**non-biodegradable**: do not degrade at all (lead, mercury)

- pollutants - environment
**Air pollutant, Water pollutant, Soil pollutant**

## Composition of Things

|Gas|Conc|
|--|--|
|N|78.084%|
|O|20.946%|
|Ar|0.934%|
|CO2|340 ppm|
|H|0.5 ppm|
|He|5.24 ppm|
|Ne|18.18 ppm|
|Ar|0.934%|
|Kr|1.14 ppm|

## Atmospheric Layers

|Layer|Height|Temperature|Chemicals|
|--|--|--|--|
|Tropo|11|15 to -56|$\ce{O2, N2, CO2, H2O}$|
|Strato|50|-2|$\ce{O3}$|
|Meso|85|-92|$\ce{O, NO}$|
|Thermo|500|120|$\ce{O, ONO}$|

- what is lapse rate?
change of temperature with height. positive lapse rate is decrease in temperature with altitude. temperature inversion happens at "pause"s

**Tropo**: Positive lapse rate. all water vapour. without pollution air remains uniform with convection currents due to heating cooling rates bw equator and poles.

**Strato**: Negative lapse rate (absorption of UV by ozone) 

**Meso**: positive lapse rate (absence of ozone like stuff). 

**Thermo**: negative lapse rate. low pressure, low densities, high temperature. 

## Air Pollutants

- primary pollutants? 
directly emitted. oxides of C, N, S, particulate matter, hydrocarbons.

- secondary pollutants?
derived from primary due to chemical stuff. (ozone, **P**eroxy **A**cetyl **N**itrate, Photochemical smog)


# CO 
colorless, odorless, tasteless, poisonous

|PPM|Effect|
|--|--|
|10|Impairment of judgement and visual perception|
|100|Headache, dizziness, weariness|
|250|Loss of consciousness|
|750-1000|Death|

**Sources**: 
- Incomplete combustion of fuels and carbon containing stuff (blast furnaces, dissociation of CO2 at high P)
- oxidation of methane
- tobacco 

**Controlling**:
- fuel modification
- substituent fuels 
- engine modification
- exhaust gas treatment

## N-oxides

##### NO
no issues on health or green plants. **ozone depletion.**
##### NO2
reddish brown, paramagnetic. 
##### Effects
- Respiratory system
- Headache
- Bronchitis
- Leaf damage
- corrosion of teeth

**Sources**:
- burning of fossil fuels
- nitrogen based fertilizer plants
- explosive industry
- coal and gas furnaces
- textile industry
- nitric acid manufacture
- decomposition of organic waste
- automobile exhaust

## SO2 + SO3

##### sources:
- volcano
- cumbustion of S containing (coal)
- transportation
- smelting of sulphide ores in metallury

#### causes (H2SO4):
- acid rain
- respiratory problems 

#### control
- use of low-sulpher fuel
